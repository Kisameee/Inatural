Funny stuff with tensorflow and image classification 


in this project we have tried to answer the challenge Inaturalist 2018

the dataset is available on

[https://www.kaggle.com/c/inaturalist-2018](https://www.kaggle.com/c/inaturalist-2018)

for that we first pretreated the data

and then we have tetsted several models to predict the subclass of an image.
